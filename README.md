# hex-practice
Generates hexadecimal/decimal conversion problems and grades user response.

This is just a simple tool for those wanting to practice mental conversion between hexadecimal and decimal numbering systems. It keeps track of how many problems the user answers right or wrong in a session and shifts the background color toward red or green depending on the percentage correct.

You can either convert from hex to decimal or vice versa.

History

When it came time for me to learn hex, I was disappointed to find no source for automatically generated practice problems, so I created one. This was years ago, when I was first getting into programming, and I originally wrote it in C#. I thought someone might conceivably one day like to use it, so I rewrote it in JavaScript.

Possible Improvement
- Add support for conversion from binary and octal
- Add informative explanation of the various numbering systems
- Add pronunciation generator based on this scene from Silicon Valley:
