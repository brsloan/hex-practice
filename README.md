# hex-practice
Generates hexadecimal/decimal conversion problems and grades user response.

This is just a simple tool for those wanting to practice mental conversion between hexadecimal and decimal numbering systems.

When it came time for me to learn hex, I was disappointed to find no source for automatically generated practice problems, so I created one. This was years ago, when I was first getting into programming, and I originally wrote it in C#. I thought someone might conceivably one day like to use it, so I rewrote it in JavaScript.
